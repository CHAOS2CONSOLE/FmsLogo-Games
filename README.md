# Video games in FmsLogo

Welcome to Video games in FmsLogo. This was made for a competition held in Croatia (hr. razvoj softwera).

### What is Logo?
Logo is an old programming laungage made in 1967. 
It used turtle graphics, which is the system where you have a "turtle" and you can make it move around.
With more time more logos evolved, thus leading to FmsLogo.

### What is FmsLogo?
If you dont know what is FmsLogo, It is a programming language made by David Costanzo.
It was made october eleventh 2005.
The most recent version was on the fifth of April 2022.
FmsLogo evolved from MSWLogo. 

### Who are we and what are we doing?
Us three, Filip (aka me), Linda and Mateo, using our knowledge in FmsLogo, made FmsLogo games.

FmsLogo games is a library of games, such as:
Hangman,
Platformer,
Tic tac toe,
Snake,
Bubble shooter

We made these games due to the lack of sources for FmsLogo, in fact, the only source that is useful for high level programming 
in FmsLogo is the index that is built into FmsLogo.

We also made this not to only prove that in FmsLogo you can create video games, but that even logo programming launguages can be complex
and high level to some degree.
