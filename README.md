Video games in FmsLogo

Welcome to Video games in FmsLogo. This was made for a competition held in Croatia.

First of all, if you dont know what is FmsLogo, It is a programming language made by David Costanzo.
FmsLogo evolved from MSWLogo. 

Logo is a type of programming language dedicated to teaching geometry, mainly to children.
Schools all around the world use it to teach kids geometry better and to better visualize the concepts taught to them.
