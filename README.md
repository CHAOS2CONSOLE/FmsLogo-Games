# Video games in FmsLogo

### Work in progress!!!

Welcome to Video games in FmsLogo. This was made for a competition held in Croatia.

### What is Logo?
Logo is an old programming laungage made in 1967. 
It used turtle graphics, which is the system where you have a "turtle" and you can make it move

### What is FmsLogo?
If you dont know what is FmsLogo, It is a programming language made by David Costanzo.
FmsLogo evolved from MSWLogo. 



Us three, Filip (aka me), Linda and Mateo, using our knowledge in FmsLogo, made FmsLogo games.

FmsLogo games is a library of games, such as, but not limited to:
Hangman
Platformer
Flappy Bird
Tic tac toe
Snake

We made these games due to the lack of sources for FmsLogo, in fact, the only source that is useful for high level programming 
in FmsLogo is the index that is built into FmsLogo.
