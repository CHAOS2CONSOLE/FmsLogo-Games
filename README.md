Video games in FmsLogo

Welcome to Video games in FmsLogo. This was made for a competition held in Croatia.

First of all, if you dont know what is FmsLogo, It is a programming language made by David Costanzo.
FmsLogo evolved from MSWLogo. 

Logo is a type of programming language dedicated to teaching geometry, mainly to children.
Schools all around the world use it to teach kids geometry better and to better visualize the concepts taught to them.

Us three, Filip (aka me), Linda and Mateo, using our knowledge in FmsLogo, made FmsLogo games.

FmsLogo games is a library of games, such as, but not limited to:
Hangman
Platformer
Flappy Bird
Tic tac toe
Snake

We made these games due to the lack of sources for FmsLogo, in fact, the only source that is useful for high level programming 
in FmsLogo is the index that is built into FmsLogo.
